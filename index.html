        <p>My name is Yurim Maeng from South Korea. when I was 19 years old, I came to the US to study abroad in the
            university. My major was Finance. Since I was nominated as a honor student and got deanâ€™s lists, I desired
            to study in the better school and finally I made an decision to transfer to the University of Indiana,
            Bloomington, which is the more famous as the business school.
            Unlike California good weather, since the weather was too cloudy, snowy, and cold, I had the depression and
            insomnia. However I could learn much better things from the school and meet many good intentional friends
            from Pakistan, India, Philippine, and China. Because they love K-POP and K-Drama, they can speak some Korean
            words and Korean food. we traveled to New York for thanksgiving day and ate Korean food and other countries
            food together in the dorm.
        </p>
        <p>After I graduated in 2018 summer, I could get a job immediately and came to Torrance to work for Amazon
            Marketing Company, which was very interested in learning about Marketing and Amazon System. However, the
            company was established 2 years ago, so there is no foundation and unstable to earn money. So I changed the
            job to the logistic company, which is more stable. Now I am still working in the logistic company in
            Cerritos. I am so happy to study coding for financial stabilty and career change for my better future.</p>
